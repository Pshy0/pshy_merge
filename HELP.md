Modules Help (basic infos and commands)
===

This page list features made available by different modules,
that may or may not be included in the runnable scripts found in the `tfm_lua/` folder (scripts ending in `.tfm.lua.txt`).



## pshy.commands

This module handles commands.

You can run a command by starting it with "`!`". 
If you included scripts that are not made by me, and if both my script and the other use the same command name:
- Prefix your commands as `!pshy.<command>` to run a command from a pshy module.
- Prefix your commands as `!other.<command>` to run a command from another module.

In this guide, commands will be presented this way:

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `!command(aliases) <required_argument> [optional_argument:default_value]` | here is what the command do |

This means you can run this command those ways:
- `!command required_argument_value`
- `!alias required_argument_value`
- `!alias required_argument_value optional_argument_value`

If you type a command wrong, then the command usage will be displayed.

If a command's argument is "`<player>`" or "`[target_player]`" then you only need to write the beginning of the player's name, as long as it is unique in the room. 
You can also use "`*`" to run the command on every single player. This works with ALL the commands.
You can also use hexadecimal codes or words for colors (for instance "#ff0000" and "red" are both valid for red). 

Failing to provide a required argument will result in the module displaying dialogs for you to input these.

You can get a list of commands with:
| `!commands(cmds) [page_index]` | List all the module's commands. |
